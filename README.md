# Atarypong

This repository is focused on making available the classic Atari pong game. For more information about the games I develop visit my "games" repository https://github.com/imdiegodev1/Games.

Here you can find a file and folder layout following the good practices that the Godot' community suggests to deploy your games. In addition, I add a .yaml file that is used for GitHub actions and I use a Github page to contain and play the games.

What we can learn with this kind of projects is how Github pages work and how to create a simple pipeline for deployment and continuous integration. A little Devops project to make a video game available.
