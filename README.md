# Atarypong

Some of my interests are video games and history and what better combination than recreating one of the most iconic video games in time. Pong is one of those first video games, its first release to the public was in November 1972 and for the time it was a product that change everything. 

To accomplish this, I learn a little bit about Godot. It is a cross-platform, free and open-source game engine with an amazng community and documentation that you can find in the followinf [link](https://godotengine.org/). In this reository you can find a file and folder layout following the good practices that the Godot' community suggests to develop and deploy your games. In addition, I add a .yaml file that is used for GitHub actions and I use a Github page to contain and play the game.

What we can learn with this kind of projects is how Github pages work and how to create a simple pipeline for deployment and continuous integration. A little Devops project to make a video game available. In addition, we have and amazing opportunity to see how a video game is made and how video game engines works.
